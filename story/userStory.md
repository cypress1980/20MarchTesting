## 📖 Story Description
As a QA Engineer,  
I want to automate the product purchase flow on the SauceDemo website,  
so that the end-to-end checkout functionality can be validated during regression testing.

This automation ensures that a user can:
- Log in successfully
- Add a product to the cart
- Complete checkout
- Receive order confirmation
